Budget tracker:
Functionalities:
● Add and re	move transactions.
● View current balance and transaction history.
● View reports on spending by category or over time.
● Edit categories and transaction details.
● Import and export data.

How to:
1. Set up your development environment:
To get started, you'll need to install the tools and dependencies
you'll be using for your project.

2. Design the layout and user interface:
Next, you'll need to decide on the layout and design of your app.
This might involve creating designs to visualize the different
screens and features of the app.
You'll also need to consider what information you want to
display to the user and how you want to present it.

3. Set up the mock-data:
Depending on your needs, you may need to set up a data
service to store and manage the data for your budget tracker.
For example, JSON file or Context file that contains pre-data

4. Build the front-end: Once you have the mock data in place, you
can start building the front-end of the app.
This might involve creating components to display the different
screens of the app, such as the home screen, the add
transaction screen, and the reports screen.
You'll also need to write code to interact with the back-end,
such as retrieving and saving data to the database (or mock
data).

To build the home screen, you might create a Home component that
displays the current balance and a list of recent transactions.
To build the add transaction screen, you might create an
AddTransaction component that includes form fields for the user to
enter the transaction details.
You could use the useState hook to manage the form data in the
component's state, and use a form submission event handler to send
the data to the context.
To build the reports screen, you might create a Reports component
that displays charts and graphs showing the user's spending by
category or over time.
You could use a library such as Chart.js to create the charts, and
pass the data as props from the parent component or from the
context file.
